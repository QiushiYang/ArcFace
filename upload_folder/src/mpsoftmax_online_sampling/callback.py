    Each checkpoint is made up of a couple of binary files: a model description file and a
    parameters (weights and biases) file. The model description file is named
    `prefix`--symbol.json and the parameters file is named `prefix`-`epoch_number`.params

    Parameters
    ----------
    prefix : str
        Prefix for the checkpoint filenames.
    period : int, optional
        Interval (number of epochs) between checkpoints. Default `period` is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    callback : function
        A callback function that can be passed as `epoch_end_callback` to fit.

    Example
    -------
    >>> module.fit(iterator, num_epoch=n_epoch,
    ... epoch_end_callback  = mx.callback.do_checkpoint("mymodel", 1))
    Start training with [cpu(0)]

    Epoch[1] Time cost=0.060
